## Introduction

Between the 5th and 22nd of February 2022, tropical cyclones Batsirai and Emnati hit Madagascar’s east coast, destroying, and flooding numerous medical and non-medical sites such as hospitals, schools and residential houses. It is estimated more than 300,000 people have been affected.

Madagascar has faced numerous extreme weather events in recent years. Southern Madagascar before the cyclone was still recovering from the effect of an exceptionally severe drought, which caused alarming levels of malnutrition.

In response to the cyclones, MSF teams began providing healthcare to areas most affected. Their challenge on the ground was to identify the specific areas which have been flooded or damaged by the cyclone and a tool with the ability to assist MSF in this challenge was MapSwipe’s new change detection project type.
