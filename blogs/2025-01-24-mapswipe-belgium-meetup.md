# Highlights from MapSwipe Meetup 2024
In mid-November 2024, the MapSwipe community gathered in Brussels for a four-day meetup to explore how we can better support humanitarian mapping, amplify our impact, and plan for the future. Hosted by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the event brought together representatives from organizations like MSF, Togglecorp, American Red Cross (ARC), British Red Cross (BRC), Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team HOT, and Heidelberg Institute for Geoinformation Technology (HeiGIT), as well as individual contributors. This meetup served as a collaborative platform to assess our achievements, share ideas, and lay the groundwork for the next phase of MapSwipe’s journey. Beyond its focus on strategic discussions, the meetup provided a rare opportunity for participants, many of whom had only interacted online, to meet in person, fostering stronger connections and collaboration.

## Day 1: Reflecting on Technology and Challenges
Johnny from BRC and Benni from (HeiGIT) kicked off with a deep dive into MapSwipe’s history and memories. From its beginnings in 2015 as a crowdsourcing tool to its current role in global humanitarian mapping, MapSwipe’s evolution has been marked by innovation and collaboration.

### Participants:
Johnny (British Red Cross)
Laurent (Former Médecins sans frontières)
Kat (American Red Cross)
Ankit (ToggleCorp)
Nicole (Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team)
Jorieke (Médecins sans frontières))
Benni (Heidelberg Institute for Geoinformation Technology)
Alex (Médecins sans frontières)
David (Médecins sans frontières)
Amar (Togglecorp)

The day started on a lighthearted note with a friendly competition to identify the “Biggest Swiper” among attendees along with some interesting quizzes. Participants then shared their individual journeys with MapSwipe, recounting how they became involved and their contributions to the platform. The group then revisited the platform’s history, reflecting on milestones such as its 2015 prototype, the 2016 app launch, and the evolution of the app, website refresh and now MapSwipe for Web.

The latter half of the day was dedicated to examining the technical aspects of MapSwipe. The group reflected on the platform’s evolution from a web-based prototype in 2015 to the current app and web versions. The group also discussed various technical challenges that currently exist. Key technical topics included:
* **System Complexity:** Participants discussed how the platform’s growing features have increased complexity, creating challenges in onboarding developers and maintaining the ecosystem.
* **Project Creation:** Attendees explored ways to simplify project creation and improve testing workflows, ensuring that errors can be quickly identified and resolved.
* **Backend and Frontend Improvements:** Ideas for transitioning from Firebase to a Django-based backend and implementing a progressive web app were introduced as potential solutions for cost reduction and scalability.
* **Deployment:** While the current deployment process enables both app and web versions to function effectively, it comes with challenges that can slow down development and impact reliability. The current deployment process also impacts developers' experience since they are not able to quickly spin off an instance and start experimenting with the application.

**Fun Fact:**
Nicole earned the title of the workshop’s “Biggest Swiper,” racking up an impressive 50,000+ swipes. A big shoutout to Jorieke for securing second place and to Jorieke’s mom for her unwavering support and advocacy for MapSwipe!\
Day 1 ended with a team dinner at a Lebanese restaurant.

The second half of Day 2 was a hybrid session where few remote participants joined to discuss how they are currently using MapSwipe.

**Remote participants:**
Letwin Pondo (HOT, Zimbabwe)
Paul Knight (BRC, UK)
Keyur Khadka (Togglecorp, Nepal)
Nash (MSF, UK)
Juan Carlos (HOT, Latam)

The remote session started with a recap of the morning session and each participant explaining how they are currently using MapSwipe and where it fits in the organisation workflow. The session focused on 2 major questions:
1. If you had a list of things that you would like to be developed that is something new or an improvement to existing App?
2. How can you help MapSwipe?

The day ended with participants answering the questions and discussing ways in which they and their organisation could help MapSwipe.

**Fun fact:**
One of the most heartwarming stories shared was by Letwin about a project in Zimbabwe that used MapSwipe to identify boreholes in her hometown. This data was later presented to the local government to address water shortages, showcasing how MapSwipe empowers individuals to drive change in their own communities.

Laurent wrapped up his time with the group at the end of Day 2. His contributions were key to the MaspSwipe's success, and his technical insights have helped pave the way for important decisions and tech choices that will drive MapSwipe forward.

![Meetup Image 4](/img/blogImages/2025-01-25-mapswipe-belgium-meetup-4.jpeg)


The second half of Day 3 was led by Jorieke and was focused on a brainstorming session on funding ideas. The participants was divided into 3 groups:

* Group 1: Possible strategies to fundraise from the public? 
* Group 2: Possible strategies to fundraise from corporate organisations? 
* Group 3: Possible strategies to receive earmarked funding and un-earmarked funding?

Each group was given roughly 20 mins to brainstorm and come back with a list of ideas to create a funding source for MapSwipe.
Here are the top two ideas from each category:
#### Public Fundraising:
1. **In-App Donations:** Adding a donation banner directly in the app to encourage users to support MapSwipe while engaging with the platform.
2. **Merchandise Sales:** Launching a line of MapSwipe-branded products, such as t-shirts or tote bags, to raise funds while increasing visibility.
#### Corporate/Private Fundraising:
1. **Clear Funding Proposals:** Developing a list of prioritized features with specific price tags to attract corporate sponsors looking for tangible impacts.
2. **Branding and Storytelling:** Enhancing storytelling around MapSwipe’s impact to appeal to potential donors and corporate partners.
#### Earmarked Funding:
1. **Feature Sponsorships:** Allowing partners to fund specific features or projects, ensuring their contributions have a clear, measurable outcome.
2. **Dedicated Volunteers:** Recruiting volunteers for specific tasks, potentially including sponsorship opportunities to cover their costs.
#### Unmarked Funding:
1. **Recognition of Supporters:** Providing perks, like branded gifts, to recurring financial contributors as a token of appreciation.
2. **Community Engagement:** Leveraging NGOs and regular users to contribute to MapSwipe through donations or other support mechanisms.\
Day 3 ended with participants discussing ways to make MapSwipe sustainable and enhancing transparency in financial governance.


**Fun fact:**
One of the ideas discussed during the fundraising session was launching MapSwipe-branded merchandise, like t-shirts or tote bags, to raise funds and promote the platform. It would be cool if we could order a MapSwipe themed Club-Mate from the store.

Rhea who previously used to work at CRC was present on the final day of the meetup.

Participants reflected on past goals (through Miro board), prioritized new ideas, and collaborated to align on key initiatives for the upcoming year.

**Key Steps in Roadmap Creation:**
1. **Reflection:** Kat and Johnny walked the participants through the previous (2020) roadmap, identifying completed and uncompleted goals to inform future planning.
2. **Idea Prioritization:** Through brainstorming and scoring, ideas were ranked based on their impact and feasibility, ensuring the roadmap addressed pressing needs while remaining actionable.
3. **Timeline Development:** High-priority items were organized into a timeline to guide implementation efforts over the coming year.

The roadmap was divided into 2 sections:
1. General Roadmap
2. Technical Roadmap

Through rigorous discussion and voting, the participants decided on the following [roadmap](https://app.mural.co/t/katkinzer9715/m/katkinzer9715/1731585514072/0423daffb9fc8a287f3591a4db711e8c90474c8f):

#### Why It Matters
MapSwipe is more than a mapping tool—it’s a collaborative effort to address global challenges through data-driven solutions. From disaster recovery to public health and environmental conservation, MapSwipe has empowered organizations and individuals to make a difference.

As we look to the future, the insights and plans generated during this workshop will help shape MapSwipe’s trajectory. Whether you’re a mapper, an organization, or a supporter, there’s a place for you in this journey. Together, we can continue to map what matters and make every swipe count.

The roadmap and ideas developed in Brussels represent a step forward. The meetup highlighted not only the challenges MapSwipe faces but also the immense creativity and resourcefulness of its community. Every session reinforced the collective commitment to bridging gaps in mapping, supporting underserved communities, and making humanitarian work more effective. The connections made and the shared vision has laid the groundwork for innovations that will shape the next chapter of MapSwipe’s journey.

#### Financial Contributions

A significant aspect of the meetup's success was its self-sustained model. All participants funded their own travel and accommodations, reflecting the collective commitment of the community. Additionally, MapSwipe Open Collective contributed USD 5,973.37, which covered shared costs like the venue, food, flights and train tickets for a few members  and other essential workshop materials. This support helped ensure a productive and enjoyable experience for everyone.
