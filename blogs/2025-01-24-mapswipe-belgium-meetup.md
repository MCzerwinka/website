# Highlights from MapSwipe Meetup 2024
In mid-November 2024, the MapSwipe community gathered in Brussels for a four-day meetup to explore how we can better support humanitarian mapping, amplify our impact, and plan for the future. MapSwipe is more than a mapping tool—it’s a collaborative effort to address global challenges through data-driven solutions. From disaster recovery to public health and environmental conservation, MapSwipe has empowered organizations and individuals to make a difference.

## Day 1: Reflecting on Technology and Challenges
The meetup kicked off with a deep dive into MapSwipe’s history and memories. From its beginnings in 2015 as a crowdsourcing tool to its current role in global humanitarian mapping, The group then revisited the platform’s history, reflecting on milestones such as its 2015 prototype, the 2016 app launch, and the evolution of the app, website refresh and now [MapSwipe for Web](https://web.mapswipe.org/#/en).

After reflecting on Mapswipe’s history from a prototype in 2015 to the mobile and web apps it is today, the latter half of the day was dedicated to examining the technical aspects of MapSwipe. The group reflected on the platform’s evolution from a web-based prototype in 2015 to the current app and web versions. The group also discussed various technical challenges that currently exist. Key technical topics included:
* **System Complexity:** Participants discussed how the platform’s growing features have increased complexity, creating challenges in onboarding developers and maintaining the ecosystem.
* **Project Creation:** Attendees explored ways to simplify project creation and improve testing workflows, ensuring that errors can be quickly identified and resolved.
* **Backend and Frontend Improvements:** Ideas for transitioning from Firebase to a Django-based backend and implementing a progressive web app were introduced as potential solutions for cost reduction and scalability.
* **Deployment:** While the current deployment process enables both app and web versions to function effectively, it comes with challenges that can slow down development and impact reliability. The current deployment process also impacts developers' experience since they are not able to quickly spin off an instance and start experimenting with the application.

**Fun Fact:**
Nicole of HOT earned the title of the workshop’s “Biggest Swiper,” having racked up an impressive 50,000+ swipes.

## Day 2: Showcasing Impact
Day two was focused on discussing the impact MapSwipe has had on communities worldwide.
Each organization present, as well as remote participants in the afternoon, shared examples of how they’ve used MapSwipe to address critical challenges, from disaster response to environmental monitoring.

**Highlighted Projects:**
* **Disaster Response:** MapSwipe data was used to locate affected areas after natural disasters like Storm Daniel in Libya and earthquakes in Afghanistan, speeding up aid delivery.
* **Community Development:** In Zimbabwe, MapSwipe helped identify boreholes and buildings to address water shortages in rural areas, empowering local initiatives.
* **Public Health Mapping:** The platform supported malaria control campaigns in Botswana by locating remote villages for field surveys.

One of the most heartwarming stories shared was by Letwin about a project in Zimbabwe that used MapSwipe to identify boreholes in her hometown. This data was later presented to the local government to address water shortages, showcasing how MapSwipe empowers individuals to drive change in their own communities.

## Day 3: Financing for Sustainability
The third day of the meetup was dedicated to MapSwipe’s sustainability—funding and financial planning. With an eye toward securing the platform’s long-term future, participants engaged in in-depth discussions about how to maintain the platform, fund feature development, and explore new revenue streams.

The day began with Amar presenting a recap of the financial overview of MapSwipe for the year 2024.

The second half of Day 3 focused on a brainstorming session on funding ideas. The participants were divided into 3 groups:

* Group 1: Possible strategies to fundraise from the public?

* Group 3: Possible strategies to receive earmarked funding and un-earmarked funding?

Here are the top two ideas from each category:
#### Public Fundraising:
1. **In-App Donations:** Adding a donation banner directly in the app to encourage users to support MapSwipe while engaging with the platform.
2. **Merchandise Sales:** Launching a line of MapSwipe-branded products, such as t-shirts or tote bags, to raise funds while increasing visibility.

## Day 4: Crafting the Roadmap
The final day of the meetup focused on crafting a roadmap for MapSwipe’s future.

**Key Steps in Roadmap Creation:**
1. **Reflection:** We walked the participants through the previous (2020) roadmap, identifying completed and uncompleted goals to inform future planning.
2. **Idea Prioritization:** Through brainstorming and scoring, ideas were ranked based on their impact and feasibility, ensuring the roadmap addressed pressing needs while remaining actionable.
3. **Timeline Development:** High-priority items were organized into a timeline to guide implementation efforts over the coming year.

The roadmap was divided into 2 sections:
1. General Roadmap
2. Technical Roadmap

Through rigorous discussion and voting, the participants decided on the following [roadmap](https://app.mural.co/t/katkinzer9715/m/katkinzer9715/1731585514072/0423daffb9fc8a287f3591a4db711e8c90474c8f):
